                Scope of var, let and const?
            </div>

                <p>var
                    Scope essentially means where these variables are available for use. var declarations are globally scoped or function/locally scoped. The scope is global when a var variable is declared outside a function. This means that any variable that is declared with var outside a function block is available for use in the whole window. var is function scoped when it is declared within a function. This means that it is available and can be accessed only within that function.

                    let
                    A block is a chunk of code bounded by {}. A block lives in curly braces. Anything within curly braces is a block. So a variable declared in a block with let is only available for use within that block. Let me explain this with an example:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    const
                    Variables declared with the const maintain constant values. const declarations share some similarities with let declarations.</p>

                Use cases of null and undefined?
            </div>
            <div class="collapse-content">
                <p>Null
                    We have heard the word "null" many times in English. Its literal meaning is having no value. The same meaning is analogous to the meaning of null in programming. Null is basically an assignment value given to a variable. The variable which has been assigned as null contains no value.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    Undefine
                    There is a subtle difference between null and undefined, but as a programmer, it is important that we understand it clearly. As the name suggests, undefined means "not defined". So we declare a variable but do not assign a value to it, the variable becomes undefined. Unlike null, the value of an undefined variable is set by JavaScript as undefined. The variable gets created at the run-time. When we do not pass an argument for a function parameter, the default value is taken as undefined. Besides, when a function doesn't return a value, it returns undefined.</p>

                Rest API?
            </div>
            <div class="collapse-content">
                <p>An API, or application programming interface, is a set of rules that define how applications or devices can connect to and communicate with each other. A REST API is an API that conforms to the design principles of the REST, or representational state transfer architectural style. For this reason, REST APIs are sometimes referred to RESTful APIs.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    First defined in 2000 by computer scientist Dr. Roy Fielding in his doctoral dissertation, REST provides a relatively high level of flexibility and freedom for developers. This flexibility is just one reason why REST APIs have emerged as a common method for connecting components and applications in a microservices architecture.</p>
